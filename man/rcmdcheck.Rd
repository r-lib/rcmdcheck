\usage{
rcmdcheck(path = ".", quiet = FALSE, args = character(),
  libpath = .libPaths(), repos = getOption("repos"), timeout = Inf)
}
\arguments{
\item{path}{Path to a package tarball or a directory.}

\item{quiet}{Whether to print check output during checking.}

\code{R CMD check}.}

\item{libpath}{The library path to set for the check.
The default uses the current library path.}

\item{repos}{The \code{repos} option to set for the check.
This is needed for cyclic dependency checks if you use the

killed. \code{Inf} means no timeout. If the check is timed out,
that is added as an extra error to the result object.}
